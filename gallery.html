			<h2>Stream Habitat Work Party</h2>
			<h3>Took place on Saturday, October 13, 2018</h3>
			<p>A few TRAA members cleared a number of fallen trees and other blockages on October 13th. Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view. If you have further questions about TRAA stream habitat projects and events, please come out to the TRAA General Meeting on Wednesday, November 14th or contact us.</p>

			<h2>Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish</h2>
			<h3>Saturday, July 14, 2018</h3>
			<p>This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish on Sharon Creek Reservoir. A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of rain to cool us off.Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as well as some bruiser carp. Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass. An informal BBQ lunch followed with Rick Ornato supplying the grill and the cooking expertise - Thanks Rick!</p>

			<h2>Work Party - Hatchery Roof Repair</h2>
			<h3>Saturday, June 30, 2018</h3>
			<p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd. Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery. At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side. It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof! The resulting damage, shown in this picture after the tree was removed, will required the replacement of these metal roof panels and the plywood sheathing underneath them. In addition, a couple of the roof trusses needed to be repaired. It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time.There were materials left over for the tool shed roof as well but that will be another day! If you have questions about this event or would like to get involved with other hatchery projects, please contact us.</p>

			<h2>Rainbow Trout Release</h2>
			<h3>Saturday, June 23, 2013</h3>
			<p>This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout. Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site. This was another successful year and those volunteers on the trout hatchery rotation are to be commended. The trout hatchery will undergo roof repairs as a result of a damaging blow from a fallen tree. Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the summer except for routine maintenance. If you'd like to be part of the hatchery rotation and other TRAA activities just contact us.</p>

			<h2>Check out the New & Improved TRAA Hatchery</h2>
			<h3>Equipment Upgrades, Building Improvements & a General "Facelift"</h3>
			<p>Over the past six months or so, a small but dedicated and determined group of TRAA members put a lot of work into making your TRAA trout hatchery experience even better! None of this could have been accomplished without grants from the MNR's CFWIP program and the OFAH through their CHP program. We found that the life of our asphalt shingles was shortened by the forested location of the hatchery because of moss and other detrimental growths. Our solution to this was to install a steel roof. A fairly routine job became precarious when near to completion, a rain shower made footing on the slick surface a challenge. Fortunately, we were able to get the last couple of panels and the cap down without mishap! The green of the new roof blends in nicely with the natural surroundings and really sets off the new stain that was applied at the same time. The hatchery' double doors were also painted TRAA green. White vented soffit panels were installed as a ceiling. Along with the new fluorescent lighting, this proved to really brighten the interior of the hatchery. This material was chosen because it will allow the ventilation required and will stand up to the damp environment in the hatchery. This view is looking from the deck and through the front doors of the hatchery. You can see how the new ceiling and light fixtures really brighten things up inside. Also note the new floor and walls which were also newly installed. Sometimes the pressure of getting everything done on time just gets to some of us! Here we're putting the finishing touches on the drain for the circular growth tank. This included a new stand pipe design that we're hoping will be a huge improvement over the old one.There was also extensive re-fitting of the drain pipes below the floor of the hatchery.This tank was refinished top to bottom including some artful fibre-glassing to fix some persistent leaks. <span class="hidden extraText"> Fingers crossed! First filling of the new growth tank and all looks well. The new standpipe worked flawlessly maintaining the perfect depth. This is the upwelling box that was installed in 2013. We made adjustments to the tray depth so we don't have to immerse our hands as far in the cold water during the dead of winter. There were also changes made to the outflow to minimize the splashing that made the floor wet (and icy!). Each tray cell and corresponding front cell (fry trap) is isolated from all the others. Once the trout fry get to the "swim-up" stage, they will come through the slots into the front cells. We then move them into the circular growth tank. The brook trout will be transferred to a separate growth tank so that they are isolated with their own separate water source. This is the growth tank for the brook trout. This was completely stripped and polished to aid in ongoing maintenance while the brookie fry are in it. A new hinged lid was also fitted to allow them a feeling of cover and sanctuary. The improvements to the TRAA's Keith Wales Memorial Hatchery will allow us to enhance our already successful track record in rearing rainbow, brown and brook trout. These improvements will also allow visitors an even better experience and opportunity to learn about trout life cycles. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far and we invite you to contact us if your group is interested in a tour.</span></p>
